Just thought I'd start using Jekyll, it would have been nice if hadn't been so quirky. Still, what do you expect for apps written in Ruby?

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

(Can't imagine I'll be needing the Ruby code markup much!!!) And the C++ is quite good..

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main() {
 return 0; 
  
}

{% endhighlight %}
