Just a handy tip for backing up precious data (in my case, my video collection)<br /><br />If you're cautious, do a test run: (ROBOCOPY can delete data!!)<br /><br /><pre>robocopy [source] [dest] /MIR /L</pre><br />The /L&nbsp; switch tells robocopy to "list only".<br /><br />Then, once you're satisfied, let it go for real by removing the /L switch..<br /> <pre>robocopy [source] [dest] /MIR </pre>
