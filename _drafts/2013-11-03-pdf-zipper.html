 I don't mean ZIP as in compressing data - I mean ZIP as like a ZIP on your trousers - joining together PDFs. I'm starting in ubuntu and installing iText.  <pre><br />sudo apt-get install libitext-java<br /></pre> better make sure I have the Java SDKs installed too  <pre><br />sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk<br /></pre> I chose v6 because i've had issues with v7 in the past.  There is an example on joining two PDF files here: <a href="http://itextpdf.com/examples/iia.php?id=123">here</a>
